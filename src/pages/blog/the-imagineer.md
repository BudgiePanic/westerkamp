# The Imagineer

> Published: 2025-11-23

So I recently read some of "My Secret Garden" by Nancy Friday.

It became quite viral on Twitter a week or so ago. I thought I would take a peek inside.

Aside from revealing the questionable inner workings of the female fantasy, it made me think of my own imagination. Not of the adult variety, no, in contrast to what the author claims of the women’s fantasy, the male’s is plastered everywhere for the world to see in the adult content of the world. If there’s an audience for it then someone is out there producing it, and in that way the male fantasy is already documented. I have little to add in that regard. 

No, I refer to the other imagination, the normal daydreaming. Often memes are shared about the male urge to ‘bleed out and die' while holding off a superior force so others may live yet.

What other ideas lurk in the male mind while under boredom?

I thought I’d start with my own. Why? Am I a particularly standout imagineer of things? I’ve not the ego to make such a claim, but what I do know is that imagining is something I do habitually, all the time, in fact, if I were to stop, then I would be a different person.

Why this is can be traced back to my childhood, at the end of each school day I was faced with a choice, walk two and a half hours from school to home, or walk one hour from school to a local playground, and play at the playground while waiting another hour or so for mother to finish work and pick me up. Play at the playground alone. 
Damned if I do, damned if I don’t. This was a time before smartphones were prevalent, in fact my phone back then was one of those beloved indestructible Nokia bricks.

Faced with such circumstances, the only option to avoid death be extreme boredom was to start imagineering. And I’ve never really stopped.
The playground become some vast planet of oil, the climbable objects, some massive industrial oil mining platform. The tree bark, the planetoid surface we must mine through to access the precious hydrocarbons below.

You know in hindsight I may have been better served navigating to a local library, hours and hours available for reading all manner of books, or perhaps my parents back then could have had us in extra-curricular activities, or god forbid, my parents taught me, at that young age, how to use the public transport system of my local area. Imagine how many hours of life may have been saved. I know for a fact I walked that route from school to home well over 2000 times in my life (and they say suffering builds character haha!). I learned later there was a bus that went straight from school to more or less our front doorstep. Learned this after leaving high school and going to university. Lucky me. I still walk most places, still learning to drive. But it’s what made me who I am, in a way.

So what else does a mind forced by circumstance to image the fantastical, to stave off insanity by boredom, think about:

- The oil rig
- The ICBM launch (from the survey marker on the floor)
- Moon zombies but it’s the house at Devonport 
- The lady friend who turns into a fantastical dragon creature while at her house (thanks childhood fiction, needs expansion into a full story, Jake Long American dragon, Danny Phantom, Maximum Ride)
- The eternal gunfight (always rounds going down range in my mind)
- Sub-orbital recon satellite over the front lawn grass
- Space fleet battles on the trampoline (thanks Star Wars)
- The couldesac robot invasion (thanks iRobot)
- The shield spire washing line (thanks Halo Reach tip of the spear)
  - Many an hour has been spent imagining myself as part of the assault force, capturing this spire, dropping the shield so the main force may assault the territory held under its shadow. The towers destruction and collapse. Falling off the edge as the floor turns vertical, debris flying. Pulling the rip cord. Parachuting down, only to join a new battle raging in amongst the trees (grass)
- The helicopter crew chief whether it was the trentham primary school playground, or more modern times, it’s always been there.
- Dinosaurs at the tree, near where we played that cricket like game, gutter board down (GBD)
- The bookshelf ship broadside exchange (looks like that Halo 1 Map, boarding action)
- The living room. The race track. The carpet? The airfield. The fireplace. The fortress.
- More recently, the FLIR observer, watching overhead. 
- The trampoline, the large space structure, the worm hole generator.

We shall try to follow the same format in [author book]
[at home, indoors]
[at home, outside]
[on the walk]
Dragon lady goes here. I’m always walking home alone in reality, but I imagine a friend and I walk the same route home, and one day she invites me over instead of our usual parting of ways. She carries a terrible family burden.
[beyond home]
One may observe that almost all of these have a military theme to them. Such is the imaginings of a kid descended from a Navy Petty Officer, a kid raised on games like Halo, Call of Duty, Battlefield, counter strike, and even younger, Kill Zone and Ratchet and Clank, films like Starwars and shows like Band of Brothers and code name kids next door. The more context one learns of me, the more they think ‘how could he anything but this?’
